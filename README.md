# InterfaceExample

Chapter 9 Exercise to work on Interfaces

Make the following changes to this project.  See comments in the code for reminders/hints.

1. Add method `getTotalPerimeter()` to the `ShapeExample` class.  
2. Calculate and print total perimeter in the `ShapeExample` `main()` method.  Use the `getTotalArea()` method as an example of how this should be structured.  

3. Complete the `Rectangle` class, which implements the `Shape` interface and has a constructor that takes two `double` parameters, length and width.  
4. In the initialization of the `shapes` array in the `ShapeExample` `main()` method, add one more element that is a new `Rectangle` with length 2.0 and width 3.0.  

5. Run your finished program.  The output should be:  

    Total area of all shapes is 21.707963267948966  
    Total perimeter of all shapes is 28.84955592153876
